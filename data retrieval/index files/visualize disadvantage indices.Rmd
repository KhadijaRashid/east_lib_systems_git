```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(leaflet)
library(sf)
#set the working directory to "index files"", where the RData file containing indices should be located, if its not already the working directory
if(!grepl("index files$",getwd())){
  setwd("index_files")
}

load("indices.RData")
```


```{r visualize_indices,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
leaflet()


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
