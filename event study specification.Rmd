Event study possible specification
$$Y_{i,ht} = \sum_{\tau=-q}^m(\beta_{\tau}D^{\tau}_{i,h,t}) + \theta_{h} + \psi_t + \epsilon_{i,h,t}$$

+ $Y_{i,h,t}$ is equal to 1 if individual i in neighborhood h moves in time t.
+ $\tau$ is an event-time indicator which is equal to the difference between year t and the year that the apartment was constructed. 
+ $D^{\tau}_{i,h,t}$ is a set of event-time dummies equal to 1 if individual i in neighborhood h is within the treatment range around the location of the new apartment.
+ $\theta_h$ represents neighborhood fixed-effects
+ $\psi_t$ represents year fixed effects
+ $\epsilon_{i,h,t}$ is the error term, which should be uncorrelated with the other terms. 

* Individuals in the treatment range of an apartment are repeated in the dataset for each event in which they're treated. The original panel dataset, where each row corresponds to individual i in year t, had 76,785 rows. The event study dataset has 87,798 rows. 
* Some rows will be eliminated if we can identify that individuals have been forcibly displaced prior to the construction of an apartment (i.e, if forced out by a landlord to make room for new construction)
* If there is a causal effect of the construction of a new apartment on displacement of nearby voucher residents, then the $\beta_{\tau}$ values will be close to zero for values of $\tau$ less than zero, and will be positive for values of $\tau$ greater than 0.
