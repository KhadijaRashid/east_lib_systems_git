## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load_and_rename_models,results='asis'}
load("regression_models/6_treatments_200_radius.Rdata")

radius_200_lm<-model_t_hood
se_200<-se_hood
treated_200<-comma(treated_rows)
load("regression_models/6_treatments_300_radius.Rdata")

radius_300_lm<-model_t_hood
se_300<-se_hood
treated_300<-comma(treated_rows)


load("regression_models/6_treatments_400_radius.Rdata")

radius_400_lm<-model_t_hood
se_400<-se_hood
treated_400<-comma(treated_rows)


#load logit  models

load("regression_models/logit_6_treatments_200_radius.Rdata")
radius_200_logit<-logit_t_hood
se_200_logit<-summary(radius_200_logit)$coefficients[,2][2]%>%
  list()

load("regression_models/logit_6_treatments_300_radius.Rdata")
radius_300_logit<-logit_t_hood
se_300_logit<-summary(radius_300_logit)$coefficients[,2][2]%>%
  list()

load("regression_models/logit_6_treatments_400_radius.Rdata")
radius_400_logit<-logit_t_hood
se_400_logit<-summary(radius_400_logit)$coefficients[,2][2]%>%
  list()



stargazer(radius_200_lm,
          radius_300_lm,
          radius_400_lm,
          radius_200_logit,
          radius_300_logit,
          radius_400_logit,
          se=c(se_200,se_300,se_400,se_200_logit,se_300_logit,se_400_logit),
          keep=c("Accumulated Developments"),
          dep.var.labels = "Voucher Resident Movement in Pittsburgh's East End",
          title = "Regressions: Probability of Movement",
          add.lines=list(c("Treatment Radius (meters)","200","300","400","200","300","400"),
                         #c("Method", "OLS","OLS","OLS","Logit","Logit","Logit"),
                         c("Rows treated",treated_200,treated_300,treated_400,
                           treated_200,treated_300,treated_400)),
          omit.stat=c("f","ser"),
          notes = strwrap("All models include year and neighborhood fixed effects. Standard errors for OLS models are robust and clustered at the neighborhood level. The outcome variable is equal to 1 if an individual living at an address in a given year moves during that year; 0 otherwise. Each treatment range is a circle around a redeveloped parcel that excludes voucher residents located on the physical parcel where redevelopment occurred."))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r lm_table, results='asis'}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
