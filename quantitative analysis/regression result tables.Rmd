## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load_and_rename_models,results='asis'}
load("regression_models/6_treatments_200_radius.Rdata")

radius_200_lm_hood<-model_t_hood
radius_200_lm_client<-model_t_client
se_200_hood<-se_hood
se_200_client<-se_client

load("regression_models/6_treatments_300_radius.Rdata")

radius_300_lm_hood<-model_t_hood
radius_300_lm_client<-model_t_client

se_300_hood<-se_hood
se_300_client<-se_client

load("regression_models/6_treatments_400_radius.Rdata")

radius_400_lm_hood<-model_t_hood
radius_400_lm_client<-model_t_client

se_400_hood<-se_hood
se_400_client<-se_client

#use starprep to correct standard errors
ses_hood<-starprep(radius_200_lm_hood,
                   radius_300_lm_hood,
                   radius_400_lm_hood,
                   se_type="stata")
ses_client<-starprep(radius_200_lm_client,
                     radius_300_lm_client,
                     radius_400_lm_client,
                     se_type="stata")

stargazer(radius_200_lm_hood,
          radius_300_lm_hood,
          radius_400_lm_hood,
          radius_200_lm_client,
          radius_300_lm_client,
          radius_400_lm_client,
          se=c(se_200_hood,se_300_hood,se_400_hood,se_200_client,se_300_client,se_400_client),
          keep=c("Accumulated Developments"),
          dep.var.labels = "Voucher Resident Movement",
          title = "OLS Regressions: Probability of Movement",
          add.lines=list(c("Treatment Radius","200","300","400","200","300","400"),
                         c("Fixed Effects", "Hood,","Hood,","Hood,","Client,","Client,","Client,"),
                         c(" ","Time","Time","Time","Time","Time","Time")),
          omit.stat=c("f","ser"))


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r lm_table, results='asis'}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
